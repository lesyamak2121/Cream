# What is located in this directory?

This directory contains some OpenBSD extensions that I developed several years ago but found useful or developed just to learn something about the system. Maybe these patches are useful for someone.

## Patches applied to the OpenBSD code

- a few older patches, I forgot them :)

## Patches *not* applied to the official OpenBSD code
